As we are counting down to [UseR! 2017](https://user2017.brussels/) conference, held in Brussels in the first week of July 2017, we are excited to announce the launch of **DSaN Blog**; a blog built and maintained by a group of the Diversity Scholars and Newbies **(DSaN)**.

And since we are R users, we decided to build the blog using [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown)package developed by [Yihui Xie](https://github.com/yihui). So we would like to thanks him for this package and the other ones that make the blogging workflow easier. We would also like to thanks [R_Forwards](http://forwards.github.io/) for their support.

In the **DSaN Blog**, we are planning to share posts about our first experience in UseR!, highlights from the conference and much more.

Stay tuned!

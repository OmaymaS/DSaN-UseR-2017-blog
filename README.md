# DSaN-UseR-2017-blog

This website aim to be a place where all R users attending [UseR! 2017 brussels](https://user2017.brussels/) will discuss and shae point of views, but posts and pages development may come from Diversity Scholars and Newbies also known as DSaN. 

As R users, the challenge is to make a website with R and R packages developped mainly by [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.name/).   

[Blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown), [R markdown](https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown), [knitr](https://github.com/yihui/knitr) and so on will be the main packages used. 

Thanks to [@R_forward](https://twitter.com/@R_forwards), [@OmaymaS](https://twitter.com/@OmaymaS_) and [@Jacquelyn_Neal](https://twitter.com/@Jacquelyn_Neal) for supports.
